I faced the three following problems while generating the pipeline:
a- The size of the ref genome was prohibitively large to download. To get the file, I contacted Osama who has already downloaded the file previously.
b- It was challenging for me to run trimmomatic on multiple files. I found a solution for this problem in this thread http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=74228
c- Indexing process using hisat2 failed producing the following the error
